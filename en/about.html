      <p>I can hear you from here: <q>wow, I was just now looking for someone to do all kinds of stuff.</q> Well, you've come to the right place.</p>
      
      <p>I especially enjoy unconventional projects that pose an intellectual, creative, or technical challenge. Even better if they also have political reach.</p>
      
      <h2>Projects I like</h2>

      <p>Video design for the stage, anticolonial and anticapitalist initiatives, weird video games, projects prioritizing accessibility, interactive installations. I usually don’t take on corporate or advertising work.</p>

      <h2>Résumé</h2>

      <p>I’ve worked as a freelancer since 2000, studied graphic design at UQAM, and took part in the founding of the <a href="http://molotov.ca">Molotov</a> and <a href="http://territoires.coop">Territoires</a> cooperatives, as well as the <a href="http://foumalade.org">Foumalade</a> and <a href="http://grandbruit.ca">Grand bruit</a> collectives. I also make a fine vegetarian poutine sauce.</p>
