      <p>Like, say, video design for the stage, visual identity work, 3D animation, interactive design, weird videogames.</p>

      <p>I especially enjoy unconventional projects that pose a creative or technical challenge. Even better if they tend toward social justice or the supersession of capitalism.</p>

      <p>I work mainly with cultural organizations, artists, research groups, and community organizations. I usually don’t take on corporate or advertising work.</p>
