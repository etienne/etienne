      <p class="intro">I do design and video and 3D. All kinds of stuff.</p>
      
      <p>I can hear you from here: “wow, I was right this instant looking for someone to do all kinds of stuff”. Well, haven’t you found precisely the right place.</p>

        <h2>Examples of cool projects I would happily work on</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Video design for the stage</li>
          <li>Anticolonial and anticapitalist initiatives</li>
          <li>Weird and quirky video games</li>
          <li>Projects prioritising accessibility</li>
          <li>Interactive installations</li>
        </ul>

      <p>I especially enjoy unconventional projects which constitute an intellectual, creative, or technical challenge. Bonus points if they also have a political and progressive reach.</p>
      
      <p>Please note that I don’t take on corporate or advertising work.</p>

      <h2>Résumé</h2>
      
      <p>I’ve worked as a freelancer for more than 15 years (one doesn’t get any younger), I studied graphic design at UQAM, and took part in the founding of cooperatives <a href="http://molotov.ca">Molotov</a> and <a href="http://territoires.coop">Territoires</a>, as well as collectives <a href="http://foumalade.org">Foumalade</a> and <a href="http://grandbruit.ca">Grand bruit</a>. I also cook a decent vegetarian poutine sauce.</p>
