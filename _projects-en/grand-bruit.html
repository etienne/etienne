    <p>In this interactive installation, the human voice becomes traces that dither and fade away. It pays homage to the abandoned village of Grand Bruit, and to the fleeting memories of its former inhabitants.</p>
    <p>A project of the Grand&nbsp;bruit</a> collective. Produced by the NFB and Arte as part of the Interactive Haikus initiative.</p>
