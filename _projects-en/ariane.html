    <p><a href="http://rodeoproduction.com/#/artists/ledastjacques">Leda &amp; St.Jacques</a> had a clear vision of the dreamlike visual effects they wanted to conjure alongside the otherworldly set and costume design. It involved pulsating lights and swarms of ethereal fireflies. I collaborated closely to help realize that vision.</p>
