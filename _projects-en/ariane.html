    <p><a href="https://www.ledastjacques.com">Leda &amp; St.Jacques</a> had a clear vision of the dreamlike visual effects they wanted to conjure alongside the otherworldly set and costume design of their video <em>Ariane</em>: pulsating lights and swarms of ethereal matter. I collaborated closely with them to bring that vision to life.</p>
